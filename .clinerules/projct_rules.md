# Project-specific rules for Cline

## Always read and follow assistant.md
Before starting any task, read the assistant.md file in the project root and follow its guidelines and instructions. assistant.md does only contain instructions for the agent but no project specific info.

Other readme files may be included in assistant.md. read them as context.
